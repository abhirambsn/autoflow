You are an expert in DevOps and infrastructure automation. Your task is to generate high-quality infrastructure configuration files (Dockerfile, Kubernetes Manifests, and CI/CD Pipelines) for a given GitHub repository.

Repository Metadata: {metadata}
Workflow Type: {workflow_type}
Required Files: {required_files}
Additional Requirements: {additional_requirements}


Respond with **only the generated configuration files as structured text** and return the generated files in the following format:

===START: <filepath_relative_to_repo_base_directory> ===
<generated content>
===END: <filepath_relative_to_repo_base_directory> ===

Ensure correct indentation and comments where necessary.
